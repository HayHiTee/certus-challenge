Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the provisions in this statement regarding notice and choice and the service agreements with our customers.<br/></p><p><b>Certus Privacy Notice</b><br/>Before May 25, 2018, Certus complies with the European Community’s data protection regime pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC, which applies to the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and restricts companies in the EEA in transferring personal data about individuals in the EEA to the United States, unless there is “adequate protection” for such personal data when it is received in the United States.<br/></p><p><b>GDPR</b><br/>On and after May 25, 2018, Certus shall comply with the Regulation 2016/679, the “General Data Protection Regulation” (“GDPR”) of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data. The GDPR supersedes EU Data Protection Directive (also known as Directive 95/46/EC).<br/></p><p><b>EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield</b><br/>Certus will in the future participate in and certify its compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. Certus is committed to subjecting all personal data received from European Union (EU) member countries and Switzerland, respectively, in reliance on each Privacy Shield Framework, to the Framework’s applicable Principles. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield List at https://www.privacyshield.gov/list.Certus complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions. Under those provisions and under certain circumstances, Certus is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives under the Privacy Shield Framework and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf.With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, Certus is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, Certus may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website, you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.<br/></p><p><b>Scope of this Notice</b><br/>This Notice does not apply to employees of Certus; this Notice addresses other data subjects residing in the EEA and Switzerland (“EAA and Swiss Persons”) whose data Certus may receive from one of its subsidiaries, prospects, customers, suppliers or other businesses in the EEA or Switzerland, e. g., prospects’ procurement managers, suppliers’ sales representatives, individual independent contractors, and EEA and Swiss residents who are mentioned or referred to in documents to be produced in pre-trial discovery proceedings, etc.<br/></p><p><b>Categories of EEA and Swiss Data</b><br/>Certus collects data processing and advisory services largely for businesses and rarely if ever for consumers. Thus, Certus solely receives business-related information from the EEA and Switzerland. Occasionally, Certus also receives contact information related to individual representatives of businesses with whom Certus is dealing (including, without limitation, names, addresses, work phone numbers, work email addresses, etc.), and, in connection with our managed document review and advisory services, Certus processes data that may be relating to EEA and Swiss residents on behalf of, and in accordance with instructions from, prospects (collectively “EEA and Swiss Data”). Since EEA and Swiss Data covered by this Notice is by definition sent to Certus by another company in the EEA or Switzerland (e.g., a supplier to Certus), the categories of data sent and the purposes of processing often depend on such other company, with whom the EEA or Swiss Persons typically have a closer employment, business or other relationship (and which therefore, can provide additional information on categories of data shared with us).<br/></p><p><b>Purposes</b><br/>Certus may collect and use EEA and Swiss Data for purposes of providing data processing and advisory services to its prospects, communicating with corporate business partners about business matters, processing EEA and Swiss Data on behalf of corporate prospects, transmitting marketing emails and performing other marketing activities, and conducting related tasks for legitimate business purposes.<br/></p><p><b>Disclosure</b><br/>Certus may share EEA and Swiss Data with affiliates and contractors, which process EEA and Swiss Data on behalf of Certus. Certus may also share EEA and Swiss Data with other third parties for the purposes for which Certus receives the EEA and Swiss Data (e.g., performance of contractual obligations) and as required or permitted by law.With respect to marketing emails, EEA and Swiss Persons may opt-out of receiving further email marketing communications from Certus by sending an email to info@certuscyber.com, or by following opt-out instructions that are contained in each marketing email. EEA and Swiss Persons may also send an email to this address to ask to opt-out of disclosures to third parties, but such a limitation on data sharing may make it difficult or impossible for Certus to provide the requested services. Notwithstanding other statements in this Notice, Certus may disclose EEA and Swiss Data where it is legally required to disclose (e.g., under statutes, contracts or otherwise) or the disclosure is permitted by law and Certus has a legitimate business interest in such disclosure.<br/></p><p><b>Access and Review</b><br/>EEA and Swiss Persons whose EEA and Swiss Data Certus holds may request access to, and the opportunity to update, correct or delete some or all of the EEA and Swiss Data that Certus holds about them. To submit such requests or raise any other questions, please contact Certus as described below. Certus reserves the right to take appropriate steps to authenticate an applicant’s identity, charge an adequate fee before providing access and deny requests, except as required by the Privacy Shield Framework.Certus will in the future comply with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States. Certus will seek to be certified by the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy statement and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.
