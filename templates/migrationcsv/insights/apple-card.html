          <p>Apple Inc. yesterday announced the introduction of Apple Card, a product developed in collaboration with Goldman Sachs and Mastercard,
            which the company is touting as a “a new kind of credit card” featuring “a new
            level of privacy and security.”In this
            article, we unpack the technology behind Apple Card, including its strengths
            and weaknesses from both a security and privacy perspective.<span
            style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The security integrated within Apple Card is
            novel as a case study for information security professionals tasked with
            protecting sensitive information.For
            example, the card lacks certain cardholder data (e.g. Primary Account Number,
            Expiration Date and CVV2) which is both integral to the function of
            conventional credit cards and at the same time a weakness.<span
            style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Another novelty and strength associated with
            Apple Card is that it leverages the heightened security of host card emulation
            (HCE) – better known as secure element (SE) – a software architecture that
            enables identification and protection of digital cards. Through these features,
            combined with many other security enhancements, Apple Card proves that it is
            possible to provide higher levels of security and privacy even on resource
            constrained devices.</span></p>

            <p><b><u>AppleCard Initialization Process</u></b></p>

            <p>In order to understand Apple Card’s overall security
            posture, we need to walkthrough the end-to-end flow from card manufacturing to
            initialization and registration with a mobile device.This provides a foundational understanding of
            the security controls built into the Apple Card payment flow.</p>

            <p>During the manufacturing process, Apple provisions
            Mastercard’s public key on the physical card chip, which is signed by the chip
            manufacturer’s public key and then syncs with Mastercard’s tokenization service,
            enabling Mastercard to validate the authenticity of their public key.
            Mastercard’s tokenization service is responsible for maintaining a registry of
            all trusted chip manufacturers and its certificates.This registry is held in a trust store, which
            verifies certificates from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).</p>

            <p>Chip-specific information such as the integrated
            circuit card (ICC) key pair and certificate are also signed by the chip
            manufacturer and provisioned on the chip.</p>

            <p>Once the consumer has received the card, <span
            class=SpellE>Mastercards</span>’ payment applet takes payment information from
            the issuing bank and securely stores it the SE. Users are prompted for a nonce,
            or special random number, to validate the user’s authenticity. For successful
            initialization of the applet, it must validate a unique device PAN signed with <span
            class=SpellE>Mastercards</span>’ public key using the tokenization API.<br/>
            </p>

            <p>On a frequent basis, Apple card performs secure key
            exchange/generation using Application Processing Data Unit (APDU) commands,
            this secure key generation replenishes encrypted tokens and unique derived
            keys.</p>


            <p>In case of a lost or stolen card, an adversary cannot
            make any transactions and the user can receive a new token and unique derived
            keys on their provisioned devices without concern about fraudulent transactions.</p>

            <p>Mastercard’s token enrollment APIs negotiate
            end-to-end encryption protocols between the secure element and Mastercard’s
            tokenization service. We speculate that the protocol leverages 3DES, which is
            then hex encoded and is concatenated with Device Encryption Key (DEK), derived
            from device key, and the device’s MAC address. Encryption is performed using
            RSA and gets signed using the ISO 9796. This ensures the key size for both
            encryption and signature to be 1024 bits.This way, the heavy lifting of encryption is handled by backend servers.
            Along with that, as there is a device key and MAC involved in the key
            generation ceremony, there are a few key generation attributes tied to the users’
            Apple Card. </p>

        <p><b><u>Secure
        Communication with Mobile Device and Applications</u></b></p>

        <p>Apple Card owners will likely need to enroll the card
        into their iPhone manually by entering the cardholder’s data into the Passbook
        application (we speculate some form of card identifier will be provided by mail
        or on the card itself to facilitate this process). The unique card identifier,
        or temporary DPAN, will then be combined with <span class=GramE>a</span>
        owner’s specific key and sent to Goldman Sachs along with their iTunes
        information such as billing address, full name and phone number over secure
        encrypted channels. Goldman Sachs would view this information in the clear but
        Apple asserts that Goldman Sachs will refrain from sharing or selling this data
        to third parties for marketing or advertising purposes. Using the information
        submitted from the owner’s iOS device, Goldman Sachs then decides whether to
        approve before allowing the user to add (or bind) the card to the Passbook app.
        At Goldman Sachs’ discretion, the bank’s process will include steps for
        additional validation that the cardholder may need to register the credit card.
        The account holder may confirm their identity with a one-time code. Once the
        identity is confirmed, Goldman Sachs will create a DPAN, which is a token-like
        value based upon the user’s personal account number and the user’s device
        specific information. The DPAN is returned to the device via a two-way transport
        layer security (TLS) connection from Goldman Sachs for storage in the iOS
        device’s SE. The DPAN, stored in the SE, is never stored on Apple Card servers,
        or backed up to iCloud. In addition, the DPAN is encrypted using the user’s
        private keys, which Apple does not have access to and so has no ability to
        decrypt. This clear segregation of keys enables Apple to ensure user privacy is
        maintained and user spending habits or payment-related information is never shared
        between the company’s servers.</p>

        <p>For secure payments, the foundational security of Apple’s
        products rests upon SE,
        which is a hardware driven, tamper-resistant solution capable of securely
        hosting payment applets, securely communicating other mobile applications and
        ensuring confidentiality and key management of sensitive data. The SE embeds
        into the NFC chip, which is used by Apple Pay at payment terminals. The NFC
        chip facilitates communication between the terminal and the SE. They
        key takeaway from the SE integration is a hardware-driven microcontroller that
        performs all the security checks for sensitive data and is segregated from the
        rest of the mobile applications. This provides strong cryptographic
        computational power in a single chip.</p>

        <p><b><u>Authenticating
        Users to Access Information</u></b></p>

        <p>Only applications created by Apple have access to
          Apple Card payment information.When the
          any mobile application is trying to access payment information such as
          transaction history or making a cash transaction, a call is made to the Apple
          Card Servers with DPAN information to obtain a timebound nonce. This number,
          along with other transaction data, is passed over an applet to the SE to
          generate a payment signature. When the payment signature comes out of the SE,
          it’s sent to Apple Card Servers over encrypted channels. The authenticity of
          this transaction is verified through this payment signature and the random
          number provided by Apple Pay Servers. After successful verification of the
          payment signature, the user’s request is initiated. If the user wants to view
          the transaction details, then temporary payment applet access is provided to
          the Apple-created mobile applications. For sending or receiving payment,
          encrypted payment transaction information is sent back to Apple Card Servers,
          which is encrypted using the user’s private key. In case additional user
          identification is requested, then that information is also handed over to
          Goldman Sachs via Apple Card servers using the user’s private key
          encryption.The only caveat is that any
          user enrolled on that device can make a payment on someone else’s behalf
          provided they can perform touch or face authentication.</p>

        <p><b><u>Conclusion</u></b></p>

        <p>As shown in this article, foundational security is
        embedded across the entire payment flow right from manufacturing to successful
        payment. Broadly, the security takeaways from Apple Card are threefold: First,
        from an architecture perspective, Apple thought through all the moving parts
        and managed to achieve security without compromising user experience. Second,
        rather than introducing a very fragmented ecosystem for payment, they narrowed
        the players to only Mastercard and Goldman Sachs, which reduces the number of
        dependencies and overall business risk. Finally, by integrating hardware-based
        security controls such as tamper resistance and SE, Apple ensured the
        foundational security of Apple Card is not software-driven, which may have
        proved more error prone than hardware controls. The only caveat to this
        approach is that if a bug is found in the hardware, a fix cannot easily be
        applied.</p>
